Little Red Riding Hood woke up and was getting ready to see her grandma. Dana had gotten this
nickname because of the hooded cape she always wore when she'd walk through the woods. Today was
warmer than usual and she was debating whether or not to wear the cape. She was also deciding if she
should touch up the color of her hair.

Should Dana...? 
1. Color her hair with "Rockin' it Redhead #9" 
2. Wear the cape as it might rain.
