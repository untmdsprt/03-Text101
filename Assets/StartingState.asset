  storyText: "Little Red Riding Hood woke up and was getting ready to see her grandma.
    Dana had gotten this nickname because of the hooded cape she always wore when
    she'd walk through the woods. Today was warmer than usual and she was debating
    whether or not to wear the cape. She was also deciding if she should touch up
    the color of her hair.\n\nShould Dana...? \n1. Color her hair with \"Rockin' it
    Redhead #9\" \n2. Wear the cape as it might rain.\n\n"
